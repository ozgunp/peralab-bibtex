  abstract = {In this study we implemented a low-cost, single EEG channel brain computer interface (BCI) running on an embedded computer. The BCI uses steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) to control the motion of the Kondo KHR-3HV humanoid robot. The subject attends to one of the flickering LEDs attached to the arms of the robot in order to move an arm. SSVEPs are identified by a simple spectrum analysis of the EEG signal.},
